# DevSecOps Journey and Projects

Currently, I’m exploring and building skills in DevSecOps. Here are some areas I’m focusing on:

## Skills & Tools
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Ansible
- Containerization using Docker and Kubernetes
- Security automation and vulnerability scanning
- Monitoring and logging with Prometheus and ELK Stack

## Future Projects
- Automating security checks in CI/CD pipelines
- Setting up secure Kubernetes clusters
- Building infrastructure with IaC tools following best security practices
- Creating dashboards for security monitoring and alerts

Stay tuned for updates as I progress in my DevSecOps career!
